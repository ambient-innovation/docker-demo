# nginx-demo

This is a simple demo project to demonstrate a Dockerfile and docker-compose
in a simple environment. It launches an apache webserver and runs a custom php file inside. 
This can be used to demonstrate
- how to start a docker container
- How to enter the container via bash and modify a file (index.php)
- How to mount a volume and use docker for local development
- How to use docker-compose to facilitate this
